Building a Multi-Container Application

Single Container Deployment Issues

- App was simple - no outside dependencies
- Our image was built multiple times
- How do we connect to a database from a container?

Application Overview

- Fancy fibonacci sequence calculator
- Gonna be over the top
- Web form that allows the user to enter an index and calculate the fibonacci value
- Display which incides have been calculated and what their values are

Application Architecture

- Back end includes:
	- Nginx -> React
				^
				|
				v
			-> Express -> Redis <-> Worker
					   -> Postgres

- postgres contains values that have been seen
- redis contains calculated values

-Flow:

user submits number -> React APP -> Express Server -> Store number in Postgres
												   -> Store index and calculated value in redis -> redis talks to a worker which does the calculating
Worker Process Setup

- This is the process that watches redis for new indicies and calculates the fib value
- changes are going in the complex directory under course_materials

- Just skipped the rest of the app setup. Moving on to section 9, where the app gets used
