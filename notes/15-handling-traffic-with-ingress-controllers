15. Handling Traffic with Ingress Controllers

Load Balancer Services

- Legacy way of getting network traffic into a cluster
- Config allows access to one set of pods
	- we want to expose two sets
- When making a load balance service kubernetes reaches out to the cloud provider to use their own type of load balancer
- Replaced by Ingresses

A Quick Note on Ingresses

- Ingresses expose a set of services to the outside world
	- ClusterIPs in our case
- Several implementations
- Use are using the kubernetes-backed ingress-nginx: github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx
- NOT kubernetes-ingress (from nginx): github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress
- Be sure to look at correct info
- Get docs from the repo to avoid confusion

One Other Quick Note!

- Setup of ingress-nginx changes depending on your environment
- We are setting it up on local and GC
- Ingress is kinda finecky

Behind the Scenes of Ingress

- Reminder that config files state the desired state of our application
- For instance a deployment views the current state and creates a migration
- Controllers work to make a desired state a reality
	- Deployments are controllers
	- Ingresses are also controllers
		- Work to ensure routing rules are setup
- An ingress controller could create a pod running nginx that handles routing
- Ingress Config -> kubectl -> Ingress Controller -> Something that accepts incoming traffic
	- ingres-nginx creates a single deployment instead of a pod

More Behind the Scenes of Ingress

- On Google Cloud you get a Google Cloud Load Balancer attached to the Ingress.
- There is a default-backend deployment, we'll be using it but in production you would want to point it to the app server
- Why go through all the trouble with the ingress?
	- Why not just add a custom nginx pod
	- The ingress nginx has extra code to make it aware it is in k8s
	- Nginx pod directly routes to pods, bypassing the ClusterIP (it's still there)
		- Allows sticky sessions

Setting up Ingress Locally with Minikube

- Walk through the installation for ingress-nginx
- Be sure to run 'minikube addons enable ingress' in addition to the quick start

Ingress v1 API Update + 404 errors

- Holds an updated version of ingress-service.yamnl

Creating the Ingress Configuration

- Similar to other configs with some extra annotations
- Directly refers to cluster ip services

Testing Ingress Locally

- Time to test the application!
- Get the ip: 'minikube ip'
- Nginx uses a fake cert, causes a warning
	- We'll fix it later

The Minikube Dashboard

- 'minikube dashboard' brings up a web page that shows the status of the kubernetes cluster
- Can create objects but you may not have a record or your yaml, or edit a pod, but this is not persisted to config files.
