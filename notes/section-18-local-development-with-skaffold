Local Development with Skaffold

Awkward Local Development

- We don't have an easy way to inject source code into a client pod
	- Have to use kubectl apply
- Skaffold is a CLI tool used to facilitate local development
	- Watches a code directory and updates k8s when it sees changes
	- 2 modes
		- Rebuild the client image from scratch, update k8s
		- Inject updated files into the client pod, rely on the app to automatically update itself
			- The pod needs to be able to update itself. Not sure how useful this will be for us. Maybe for pdi repository?

Installing Skaffold

- See skaffold.dev/docs/getting-started for instructions

The Skaffold Config File

- Check the skaffold.yaml file
- Docs at skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml

Live Sync Changes

- Start skaffold with 'skaffold dev'
- Change something in one of the js files and check the log for changes
- Currently this appears to be broken in v1.35.2

Automatic Shutdown

- When shutting down skafold it deletes development pods. Nice when working on different projects
- This deletion will also take out databases or volumes
	- Don't add persistent data handling to Skaffold!

Testing Live Sync with the API Server

- Add worker and server configs
