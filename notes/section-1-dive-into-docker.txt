Dive into Docker!

Why do we use Docker?

- Docker wants to make it really easy and straightforward to install and run software on any computer
- Gives redis as an example
	- An in-memory datastore
	- Standard installations can run into problems like missing packages
	- Running a single Docker command makes it very easy

What is Docker?

- Docker is a platform/ecosystem around creating and running containers
- An image is built from a Dockerfile or downloaded from Docker Hub
- Containers run instances of images

Running Hello World

- Docker client talks to docker server
- Docker server checks if it has Hello World in its image cache
- It doesn't find it so it looks for the image on Docker Hub
- Downloads that image and stores it in the image cache
- Goes to the image cache for future container launches
- Now an instance of the Hello World image is created as a container

But what is a container _really_?
- Diagram of a diagram of processes making system calls to the kernel, which then interacts with actual devices
- System calls are basically function invocations
- Thought experiments with two services on the same system that need different verions of python and only version can be installed on the system
	- OS tool called namespacing could be used to separate the hard drive into sections that each handle separate portions of the hard drive
		- Namespacing isolates resoures per process or group of processes
		- Doesn't have to just be the hard drive. Can be network, useres, hostnames, processes, etc.
	- Control groups are used to limit the amount of resources a process can use
		- Memory, bandwidth, etc
-A container is a process/set of processes which have a grouping of resources specifically assigned to it.

-Process -> System call -> Kernel -> Direct call to specific portions of HDD, network, RAM, CPU, etc

-Images are actually filesystem snapshots, like a with a VM
	- Images also contain a startup command (ex run chrome)

-When starting a container
	- Image is placed in section of the hard drive reserved for the container

How does Docker run on my computer?
	- Namespacing and control groups are not part of every operating system.
		- They belong to Linux
	- For non-Linux operating systems a Linux virtual machine is created to run Docker containers
